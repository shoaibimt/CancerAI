## CancerAI

## Prediction of small molecules as potent inhibitors of various cancer targets using Artificial Intelligence (AI)

## Description

It is a framework centered around Python, specializing in machine learning and deep learning for the field of drug discovery. Equipped with an array of features, it streamlines various drug discovery and chemoinformatics challenges. Its foundation incorporates **Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PaDEL** etc. facilitating the creation of personalized machine learning and deep learning models or the utilization of existing ones. Furthermore, it leverages the **RDKit** framework to calculate ADMET properties.
